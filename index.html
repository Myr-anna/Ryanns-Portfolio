  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a sophomore at IE University pursuing a Bachelor in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, graduating in 2028. My academic work and projects focus on areas such as simulation and modeling, and machine‑learning foundations. I am gaining hands‑on experience through coursework, personal projects, and research in the Robotics & AI Lab, where I work with Python, Arduino, and robotic simulation tools.</p>
  <p>Alongside my technical skills in C, Python, Java, and cloud‑based tools, I bring strong problem‑solving and collaboration skills developed through both academic and professional experiences. I am eager to apply my knowledge to real‑world challenges and contribute my software skills as a robotics intern, research assistant, or more in Summer 2026!</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Monte Carlo Integration</h3>
    <p>Applied Monte Carlo methods to approximate integrals through random sampling, including estimating π and solving inference problems using random sampling. The technique samples points randomly in a domain and uses the sample mean to approximate the integral, which is particularly useful for high‑dimensional integrals【680102909667571†L148-L154】.</p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, NumPy, Matplotlib</p>

  </div>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Discrete‑Event Simulation – Hospital Queue</h3>
    <p>Built a discrete‑event simulation using SimPy to model a hospital queue system. SimPy is a Python‑based discrete‑event simulation system that models active components such as messages, customers and other entities by parallel processes and provides resource facilities and ways to record results【608229278128739†L133-L139】. The model analyzed waiting times and system efficiency for patients.</p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, SimPy</p>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Logistic Regression – Titanic Survival</h3>
    <p>Developed a logistic regression model to classify Titanic passengers as survivors or non‑survivors. The project involved cleaning the dataset, engineering features (e.g., extracting titles from names), optimizing the classification threshold using ROC analysis, and evaluating accuracy (≈82%). Logistic regression is a supervised machine‑learning algorithm widely used for binary classification tasks【120886233947787†L377-L392】.</p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, Pandas, scikit‑learn</p>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Jewelry Store Order Manager (C Project)</h3>
    <p>A console‑based application developed in C for managing customer orders at a jewelry store. Features include viewing orders, searching by customer or email, adding new orders, deleting existing ones, filtering by status, and editing order status. Orders are stored in a CSV file and loaded on startup.</p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> C, Standard Library</p>
